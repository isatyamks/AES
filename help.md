## **Steps to Build the Secure Exam-Taking System**

### **1. Overview of the System**
The system will have two main components:
1. **Frontend (User Interface)**: This is where the exam-taking experience happens, including the test UI, face detection, and security monitoring.
2. **Backend (Server-Side Logic)**: This part handles user authentication, stores data securely, performs cheating detection, and processes AI/ML models.

### **2. Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: React.js or Vue.js (Dynamic exam interface)
- **Backend**: Python (Flask or FastAPI)
- **Database**: SQLite (for lightweight local storage), MongoDB/PostgreSQL for scalable systems
- **Face Detection**: OpenCV
- **Cheating Detection**: OpenCV (for head/eye movement), machine learning models for pattern recognition
- **Security**: Blockchain for logging actions, secure authentication via JWT
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Socket.io for notifications, WebSockets for updates between client and server

### **3. Frontend (Exam Interface)**

#### 3.1 **Create Exam UI**
- **Form Design**: Design the exam interface where students will answer questions. The exam UI should be clean and simple to avoid distractions.
- **Components**:
  - **Questions**: A list of questions, answers (multiple-choice, true/false, etc.).
  - **Timer**: A countdown timer to limit the exam duration.
  - **Security Monitoring**: A section where live feedback from face/eye detection will be displayed (e.g., “Your face is too far from the screen”).
  
#### 3.2 **User Authentication**
- Use **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for secure authentication. On login, a student should authenticate using government-issued ID and facial recognition.

#### 3.3 **Integrate Face Detection**
- Integrate **Webcam Access** to capture real-time images for **face recognition**.
- Display instructions or warnings if the student's face moves too much or if the eyes are detected to be looking away.

### **4. Backend (Python Server)**

#### 4.1 **Setup Flask/FastAPI**
- Create a backend with **Flask** or **FastAPI** (both are Python frameworks).

#### 4.2 **Endpoints for Authentication and Test Submission**
- **Login Endpoint**: Handles authentication. Upon login, validate the user's credentials and perform face detection and ID verification.
- **Start Exam Endpoint**: Once logged in and verified, allow the student to start the exam.
- **Submit Exam Endpoint**: After completing the exam, submit answers to the server.

#### 4.3 **Database Integration (SQLite)**
- Use SQLite for lightweight local storage or MongoDB/PostgreSQL for a more scalable solution.
- **SQLite Example**: Store user data, exam questions, and results.



### **5. AI/ML (Cheating Detection)**

#### 5.1 **Face Detection and Head Movement**
- Use **OpenCV** for real-time face detection. This ensures the student is looking at the screen and not distracted.
- **Eye Detection**: Track eye movements to ensure that the student is focused on the test.
- **Head Movement Detection**: If the head moves too far away from the camera, it should trigger an alert.


#### 5.2 **Cheating Detection ML Models**
- Use pre-trained models for detecting suspicious behavior (like head tilts, multiple faces, or monitoring a person’s gaze). Train your own model if needed, using labeled datasets.
  
#### 5.3 **Real-Time Feedback & Actions**
- If the AI detects suspicious behavior (e.g., head tilting, eye movement), send feedback in real time to the frontend, telling the student to adjust.
- If suspicious behavior exceeds the threshold, trigger automated actions like **locking the exam interface** or **logging the event** on the blockchain for tamper-proof tracking.

### **6. Security Measures**

#### 6.1 **Browser Lockdown/Full-Screen Mode**
- Use Electron.js or Kiosk Mode (in the browser) to ensure the student cannot switch tabs or use other applications during the exam.

#### 6.2 **Blockchain for Logging**
- Use **Blockchain** (e.g., Ethereum or Hyperledger) to log every action taken by the student (e.g., face detected, eye movement exceeded threshold). This ensures that there is an immutable record of actions that can be audited by the examiner.

#### 6.3 **Encrypted Communication**
- Ensure that all data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted using **SSL/TLS**.

### **7. Final System Workflow**
1. **Login/Registration**: The student logs in using government ID and undergoes face detection.
2. **Test Start**: Once verified, the exam interface starts, and real-time face and eye tracking begins.
3. **AI/ML Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the student for cheating behaviors.
4. **Final Submission**: After the exam is completed, results are logged and analyzed. The system creates a detailed report about the student’s behavior during the exam, including detected cheating attempts.
