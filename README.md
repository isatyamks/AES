Task Proposal: Building a Secure Online Exam System with Anti-Cheating Features
Project Overview:
The goal is to design and develop a secure online exam system with advanced anti-cheating security, real-time detection of suspicious behavior, and secure data storage. The system will utilize computer vision, audio analysis, and blockchain for data integrity.

Key Features:
Anti-Cheating Security:

Exam Functionality Restriction:
Lock down system functionality: Implement a feature to disable browser access, prevent access to other software, and block keyboard shortcuts. This can be achieved by building a custom "exam mode" that limits the user's actions during the exam.
Mouse-only Interface: Design an interface that only allows interaction through mouse clicks to ensure no external commands can be entered via keyboard.

ML??????????????????????????????????

Automatic Data Entry (Facial Recognition & ID Verification): Integrate facial recognition using OpenCV or deep learning models to verify the userâ€™s identity. Combine this with OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to match government-issued IDs for added security.
Cheating Detection:

Computer Vision:
Head Movement & Eye Gaze Tracking: Use OpenCV or deep learning models like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to track head movements and eye gaze. This will help detect if the user is looking away from the screen too often or engaging in suspicious movements.
Detection of Multiple Faces & Reflections: Implement face detection algorithms (like Haar Cascades or Dlib) to detect if multiple faces appear in the exam environment, or if reflections in glasses or windows show unauthorized individuals.

Audio Analysis:
Background Noise Detection: Use audio processing techniques (e.g., noise filtering, voice activity detection) to analyze surrounding sounds and flag suspicious noises like conversations or audio clues.

Behavioral Analysis:
Suspicious Patterns: Use machine learning algorithms (like anomaly detection) to flag suspicious behavior patterns such as frequent glances away from the screen or excessive movement.
Cheating Prevention:

Warning System: Implement a real-time feedback system that warns candidates when suspicious behavior is detected (e.g., looking away from the screen, movement outside the allowed range). This will use triggers from computer vision and audio analysis.
Session Termination: If suspicious behavior is detected repeatedly or severely (e.g., multiple face detection or high levels of background noise), the system will automatically block or terminate the exam session.
Secure Exam Data:

Blockchain for Tamper-Proof Records: Implement a blockchain to securely store exam logs and results. Each action (e.g., logins, answers submitted) is recorded on the blockchain to prevent tampering and ensure exam integrity.
Data Encryption: Use end-to-end encryption for all communication between the exam client and the server to protect sensitive exam data and personal information.
